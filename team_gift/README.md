# TeamGift

Demonstrating my ability to write concise, easy-to-read Object-Oriented Ruby code (e.g. good design patterns, objects, not hashes; separation of concerns, etc.)...  RegEx and the selectors used to parse scraped web page data are less important for this assignment.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'team_gift'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install team_gift

To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Usage

This Gem is for usage by Sports Treasures, a company that makes thoughtful, inclusive end-of-season gifts for team athletes.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
