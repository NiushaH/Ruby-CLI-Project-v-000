The Journey of 625 Hours Begins One Step

Enrollment
How I Showed Up at Flatiron School’s Remote Online Web Developer Program

Circumstance & Journey
Life has all kinds of twists and turns. Most recently, I realized that I want to play to my strengths in my career and so I took the time over a couple of months to take an inventory, rally a support group, reach out for resources within my community at the library and beyond, and looked within to see what kind of skillset would enable me to live and reach the success and life I want to build. This helped me commit and feel good about the choices I was about to make.

Reflection & Assessment
I realized that many of my strengths pointed toward the combination of creativity and logical analysis that web development and coding offers in it’s career along with the ever-learning motto to stay on top of the industry and reach new heights. As the child of parents who were fascinated by artificial intelligence, philosophy and innovation, I’ve used tech as a tool since I was six years old. My favorite games were creating my own pinball game on a Macintosh and playing Pacman on a DOS 86. Yes, I just dated myself, and that’s okay because Pacman still is one of my favorite games!

Vision Board & Goals
I want to create a life that allows me to connect with people globally and contribute to teams that help improve lives so that users of technology can benefit from a more efficient life and choices that are enhanced via reliable data at their fingertips. There is so much wonderful to experience in our world, why not use the tools we have created to make life even easier and create a better lifestyle for the world at large? I’ve always had a passion for world development and changemakers and I’m in love with how technology can be a tool to create a better world.

Support Team & Faith
I explored many programs similar to Flatiron School before joining (notably Bloc, Hack Reactor, The Firehose Project, Byte Academy, Code Mentor, and Free Code Camp) the remote online web developer program.

Three things stood out about Flatiron School that prompted me to enroll and I’ve never looked back as I know I made the best choice for me:

the positive, growth mindset culture that is woven throughout the Flatiron School Education and Technical Coaches,
the curriculum simulates on-the-job developer realities, and
the interactive Learn platform that truly helps a human feel connected to a community that’s instantly and regularly accessible though geographically miles away.

Path Ahead
I’m excited about the future and thrilled to be at a school where I have faith that I will become a marketable, skilled web developer. Thank you Avi, Katie, Michael and team at large for making Flatiron School a place to be and thrive.
