Mastering coding skills

Mastering coding skills is all about learning a tool that will allow me to contribute solutions that make people’s lives easier.

The beauty of code is that we can create some of the things we wished existed. Wishing that something existed is how dreams are born. I dream of an app that helps families find their best place to plant roots by triangulating data about places and schools so they can live their best life.

Villagetopia is an application in its infancy that I envision helping hundreds, if not thousands, of families interested in moving from their current community find the next best place for their family to live and thrive, a place where there are schools to help their child(ren)’s learning needs.

Step one is here as a command line interface (CLI) application that I wrote to help parents find schools that help serve students who are gifted learners. This unique type of student has needs which some schools focus on fulfilling so that our nation’s brightest can excel and contribute to making our world a better place.

Building this Gifted School Resource entailed scraping data about schools so that a user could find the information about gifted schools across the country in a user-friendly way.

Would you be interested in trying the CLI app? If so, pull down a Github repository branch from https://github.com/NiushaH/Ruby-CLI-Project-v-000.

Or, watch a demo of the CLI app at: https://youtu.be/rPW-RgfchrA

This is the first step of many to build Villagetopia… a tool to help society in the realm of education by harnessing the power of technology to present data in a helpful way so families can have the best live(s) possible, with children equipped to reach their potential, and fulfill their dreams.

I’m excited about how software engineering can streamline and maximize efficiency in the workplace and across society. Anything is possible if you have knowledge and invest the time to create it.
